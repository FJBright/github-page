# Project Seng302 - 

This was my team's Seng302 project from 2021. In this we collaborated to build a frontend in JavaScript with the Vue.js framework (a library of GUI components).
On the backend we developed in Java with the Spring Boot framework.
npm and Gradle for the backend and frontend package managers respectively.
We made use of Gitlab CI to automate unit and Cucumber tests.
During the course we were encouraged to reflect on our work, how we worked as a team, and make future considerations.
